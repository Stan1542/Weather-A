# Weather Application

## Summary:
This weather application is a product of my journey into learning APIs with the assistance of YouTube tutorials. As a beginner, I found creating a weather application to be an excellent exercise in API integration. The app provides users with current weather information and a 5-day forecast. Users have the option to input a city name or utilize their device's current location to retrieve weather data. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing APIs within my applications and honed my backend development skills, particularly in JavaScript's location functionality. While my primary focus was on functionality rather than design, I aimed to keep the user interface as straightforward and intuitive as possible.

## Features:
- Real-time weather updates
- 5-day weather forecast
- User-friendly interface
- City search functionality
- Current location detection

## Future Enhancements:
- Improved design elements
- Additional weather data display options
- Integration with more weather APIs for enhanced accuracy
- Incorporation of advanced features like weather alerts and historical data retrieval

## Getting Started:
To get started with the Weather Application, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in your preferred code editor. Ensure you have an internet connection and any necessary API keys for weather data retrieval.
